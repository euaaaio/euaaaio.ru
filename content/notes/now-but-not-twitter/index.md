# Now, but not Twitter

Following people's latest updates and activities on social media is challenging.
You should search, follow, and mix personal, entertainment, hobbies, and work.
The feed becomes complicated, and regular social media reading becomes a chore.

Some people have a separate channel or blog for personal and professional.
Twitter, for example. But even there, you find uninteresting and sometimes even
misunderstood posts and replies. It's hard to filter. It takes a lot of work
to find out where and what the person is currently working on and how
his projects are evolving.

I found a solution from Carl MH Barenbrug, the founder
of [Minimalissimo](https://minimalissimo.com) - on his website, he made
a [“now” page](https://cmhb.de/now). There he writes about his work, projects,
experiments, studies, hobbies, and cats. All in one list with the date
of the last updated.

I made one for myself and now keep it up to date: https://euaaaio.ru/ru/now/.
