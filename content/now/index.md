# What I’m working on now

- Developing the first public version of the [Postanu](https://postanu.com).
- Researching stuff for a relaunch of the Grid Journal with a new name, style, and content.
- Preparing a secret project for [Suprematist](https://suprematist.cc).
- Experimenting with visual techniques in the design of collaborative applications.
- I don’t give up working on my website: I layout ready-made layouts, draw new ones.
